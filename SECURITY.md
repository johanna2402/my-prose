## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project or in the Prose Builder library it depends on, we encourage you to report it responsibly.

## How to Report an Issue
In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the "Security" tab of the associated GitHub project. This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.

## Notes

- This project is a demonstration app using the [Prose Builder](https://github.com/bs-jokri/prose-builder) library.
- If the issue is found in the library itself, consider reporting it upstream.

Thank you for helping keep this project safe and secure!
